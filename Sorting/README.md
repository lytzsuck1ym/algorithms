Sorting 
=======

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort


###Running time

I've included a file 'data', generated by the python script test_gen.py which contains 50000 random numbers.
Then I did this:

```sh
$ g++ _some_Sort.cpp -o a
$ time ./a < data > out
$ real 0m0.xyzs
  user 0m0.xyzs
  sys  0m0.xyzs	

``` 

Where user+sys gives us the CPU time the process used, and real gives the wall clock time,from start to finish.
This is what I got for sorting 50,000 numbers.
                    
* Bubble Sort:   : 14.199s
* Insertion Sort :  7.159s
* Heap Sort      :  0.085s
* Merge Sort     :  0.080s
* Quick Sort     :  0.069s   ( 205x faster than Bubble sort!! )
